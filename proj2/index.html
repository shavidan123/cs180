                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>In this project, we explore the use of filters and frequencies in image processing. The project is divided into two parts where we work with gradient magnitude computation, unsharp masking, hybrid images, and multiresolution blending. Each section details the process and provides visualizations to demonstrate the results.
                I would say that the most interesting thing that I learned from the project as a whole is how to use low and high pass filters to get different effects on the human eye from photos. I didn't really have any signal processing experience before this class.

            <!-- Gradient Magnitude Computation Section -->
            <div id="section2" class="description">
                <h2>Gradient Magnitude Computation</h2>
                <p>We compute the gradient magnitude of an image to detect edges. The reason why we are able to do this is because the gradient magnitude of the image corresponds to the intensity of the greatest change
                in the image. This is useful for edge detection because edges are where the intensity of the image changes the most. The magnitude is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of squared partial derivatives
                Gx and Gy, which correspond to the directional changes in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively. My specific approach was as follows: A finite difference kernel was created for the x and y partial derivatives using np.array([[1, -1]]) for x and np.array([[1], [-1]]) for y.
                These kernels were applied to the image using scipy.signal.convolve2d to compute the partial derivatives in each direction. The gradient magnitude was then calculated by combining these derivatives using np.sqrt(dx_deriv ** 2 + dy_deriv ** 2), effectively taking the L2 norm of the gradient vector at each pixel to produce the final edge image.
                Below is an example of the computed gradient magnitude of the cameraman image, shown split into its x and y components before being combined:

                <h2>Answers to Questions (1.2)</h2>
                <p>In part 1.2, we are asked to compare the effects of different window sizes in the SSD computation, and how downsampling affects the alignment of images. Through experimentation, we found that smaller window sizes lead to better alignment in smaller images, while larger window sizes struggle with fine details. The use of image pyramids greatly improves alignment in larger images by reducing the search space.</p>
